This is the problem statement for the Bhavan mess management system in order to efficiently manage the basic functionality of every bhavan mess. You have to implement a bhavan mess management system with all the details explained. Currently, all bhavan messes are managed manually by officials with minimal transparency. This should be eliminated, and a digitized transparent system must be implemented. 

This system has two main use case perspectives :

•	The student’s perspective

•	The Mess official’s perspective


The Student’s Perspective :

The menu of a particular week is pre-decided so that the mess officials can be helped. The student gets to know the daily mess menu for all meals – breakfast , lunch , snacks and dinner. This menu is provided to the students at the start of each week. For the system to work efficiently, the officials should have all the needed information about all the students of that Bhavan. This includes the name, email-Id, phone number , enrolment number. By providing these details the students, increase the transparency with the management committee of the mess. The student get to give feedback about the mess in general, be it about the food or about the infrastructure or the workers in the mess. The students also get access to a pre formulated FAQ that might help them sometime. The students also get access to the necessary details about the workers of the mess.

The Mess Official’s Perspective :

The Mess officials register themselves and work on salary basis rather than daily wages. This increases their job security and transparency with the management committee of the bhavan mess. For the registration, the workers have to put in their name, phone number, copy of ID card, their shift timings and they get their salaries updated on the information portal. The committee digitalizes the expenses of the mess. There are two types of expenses : weekly and fixed. The weekly expenses include that of Raw materials for food , soaps for daily use and other extra items for daily usage. The fixed expenses include that of infrastructure , plates etc , lightings and fans etc. The weekly expenses must be updated on a 7-day basis to properly manage the financial department of the mess. The mess workers also have to update the daily wastage of food in the system so that it is minimized. The mess workers also get to give a feedback about the current managerial system of the mess. They can give their inputs for efficient working of the mess.
